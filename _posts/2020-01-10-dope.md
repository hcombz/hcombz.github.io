abstract: "We introduce DOPE, the first method to detect and estimate whole-body 3D human poses, including bodies, hands and faces,
in the wild. The main challenge being the lack of
in-the-wild data with labeled whole-body 3D poses, we propose to take
advantage of part-specific datasets to train independent experts,
namely a body, a hand and a face expert, and distill their knowledge into
a single deep network designed for whole-body 2D-3D pose detection.
A distillation loss encourages the whole-body predictions to mimic the
experts’ outputs."
