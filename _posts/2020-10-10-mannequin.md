abstract: "Despite the apparent advances in Pose + Shape prediction from single images, qualitative benchmarks are still missing.
     We present a pipeline to easily produce and validate a dataset of in the wild images that will allow such a benchmark.
   We make use of the recently introduced Mannequin Challenge dataset which contains in-the-wild videos of people frozen in action like statues and leverage the fact that people are static and the camera moving to accurately fit the SMPL model on the sequences.
    A total of 24,428 frames with registered body models are then selected from 567 scenes at almost no cost, using only online RGB videos."
